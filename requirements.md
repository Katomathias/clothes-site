## You will need the following tools before you can begin typing away.

1. react-router-dom to manage our routing within our application.
   Install by running `npm install react-router-dom`
2. uuid to generate unique ids for all the items in our products object.
   Install by running `npm install uuid`
3. react-icons for our icon package within the application.
   Install by running `npm install react-icons --save`
4. Basic understanding of React Hooks, specifically the useState and useEffect hook on how to fetch and display data. This is not a top-tier requirement because I try to explain everything as best I can and they are very easy concepts to grasp.

#### Note:

- Since they are all npm packagaes, you can install all of them in one go by typing `npm install react-router-dom react-icons --save uuid`
